Fillit

A Hive Helsinki project I did together with my fellow student jjamsa.

The Goal:
Fillit is a project that presents a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities within a reasonable timeframe. The aim of the program is to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set in the smallest possible square.
A Tetriminos is a 4-block geometric shape used in the game Tetris.


As a parameter, the program will take a file which contains a list of Tetriminos. The program arranges them so that they create the smallest square possible using all the blocks. The main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
